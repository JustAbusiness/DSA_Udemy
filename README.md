## Data Structures and Algorithms in Java - README

Overview
This repository is a comprehensive guide to studying Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It covers fundamental and advanced concepts, providing detailed explanations, examples, and practice problems. The primary goal is to help you develop a strong understanding of DSA concepts and their implementation in Java.


Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Sao chép mã
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Java.git
Open the project in your preferred IDE.
Navigate to the src directory to explore various data structures and algorithms.
Usage
Running Examples
Each data structure and algorithm has its own Java file with detailed comments and examples. To run an example:

Open the corresponding Java file in your IDE.
Run the main method to see the output.
Running Tests
Tests are provided to ensure the correctness of implementations. To run the tests:

Navigate to the tests directory.
Run the test files using your IDE's test runner or via the command line.
